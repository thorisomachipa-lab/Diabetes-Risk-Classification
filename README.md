# Diabetes-Risk-Classification
 • Designed and trained an interpretable Decision Tree classifier to predict patient diabetes status using clinical and demographic features. 
 • Applied feature selection and model complexity control (tree depth, minimum samples) to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.
 • Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 • Interpreted decision paths and feature importance to support explainable, data-driven healthcare insights.
 • Demonstrated understanding of classification modeling, bias–variance trade-off, and model evaluation. 
 • Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
This project applies a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic using clinical and demographic health indicators. The objective was to build an interpretable and well-regularized model capable of capturing non-linear relationships while minimizing overfitting. The workflow included data preparation, train–test splitting, controlled model complexity through hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. The results highlight the importance of features such as glucose levels and BMI in determining diabetes risk, demonstrating how machine learning can support data-driven healthcare decision-making through transparent and explainable predictions.
